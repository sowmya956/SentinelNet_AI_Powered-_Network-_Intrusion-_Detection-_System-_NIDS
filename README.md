## SentinelNet: AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
# Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) capable of
identifying malicious network trafic and cyber-attacks in real time. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the
system will classify trafic as normal or suspicious based on historical data. The tool will process network trafic
data, extract relevant features, train classiication models, and generate alerts for detected anomalies.
